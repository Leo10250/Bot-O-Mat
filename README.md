## Program Description

1. Program will first prompt users to provide the name and the type of robot that users want to create. Users will then have the option to create another robot. Enter `Y` to create another robot, and `N` or any other input to continue.

2. Program will randomly assign the robot/robots tasks from the task list(Note some robots complete certain tasks at a faster rate, and some complete certain tasks at a slower rate). When a task is finished, it will be removed from the task list. Robots will not be assigned with finished tasks from the list unless all tasks are finished. If all tasks from the list are finished, program will notify the user. The task list will then be restored to its original state, and the remaining robots will re-do the tasks from the tasks.

3. Once all robots have finished their tasks, program will display a leaderboard, ranking robots by their completion time. The robot that took the least amount of time to complete all five of its tasks will be ranked Number 1.

4. Program will prompt users with the option to exit the program. Enter `Y` to exit, `n` or any other inputs to repeat the program.
